# MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Groq

## üìö About the Project
> This project is an adaptation of the [MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/) course from DeepLearning.AI, modified to use Groq models instead of Anthropic models.

## üéØ Objective
Develop rich-context AI applications using:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Groq language models
- Client-server architecture
- Integrated research tools
