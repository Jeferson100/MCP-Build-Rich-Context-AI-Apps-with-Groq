    "summary": "Extending the successes of lattice quantum chromodynamics(QCD) at zero as\nwell as nonzero temperatures to nonzero density is extremely desirable in view\nof the quest for the QCD phase diagram both theoretically and experimentally.\nIt turns out though to give rise to some conundrums whose resolution may assist\nprogress in this exciting but difficult area, and should therefore be sought\nactively.",
